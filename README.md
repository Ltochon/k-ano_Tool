## Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide an anonymization tool to k-anonymize a database with algorithms based on weights for each attribute and to implement a tool to easily create the wanted tree of generalization. 

## Description of the project

The algorithm called *Datafly* is an algorithm for providing anonymity in medical data [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datafly_algorithm)]. This algorithm is based on a greedy approach and global generalization with tuples suppression [[2](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lxiong/cs573_s12/share/slides/03anonymity_generalization.pdf)]. The goal will be to use this algorithm to provide k-anonymity of a dataset by incorporating weights on the attributes to evaluate the importance of each one of them. Indeed, the main purpose of this project is to allow the user to choose which one of the different attributes must be generalized first and on the opposite side, which one must not be generalized. 

This anonymization algorithm will be deployed on a web application written in Python through the framework *Flask*. 

In a second time, an interface on the same web application will be created to provide a tool to the user to easily create his own tree of generalization. 

The crucial point of this project is to do a user-friendly tool with easy interactions to make the experience as simple as possible.

This project will focus on the medical domain to handle a single use case and go as deep as possible to provide a complete tool.
